# üñ•Ô∏è ScreenNShot
A simple software that runs in background and allows you to create PDF files from multiple screenshots.

# Why did you make this?
During the COVID-19 pandemic, my friend started his academic studies, which meant: a lot of ZOOM classes.<br>
He was complaining about having to type manually everything the teacher writes on the board, or having to take multiple screenshots instead.<br>
So I just created this small utillity, that allows him to take screenshots to memory, and whenever he needs the output - simply press another button and get a PDF saved.

# What is `Update`?
That's a small utillity based on `Rocket Network's RNAU` that allows me to update ScreenNShot automatically.
